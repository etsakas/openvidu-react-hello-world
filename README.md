This project was created by running  
npx create-react-app openvidu-react-hello-world

Dependencies were installed by running inside openvidu-react-hello-world folder  
npm install openvidu-react --save  
npm install axios --save

--save argument saves the dependencies in package.json file. Now, after deleting node_modules folder, we only need to run npm install.

Several warnings appeared. We will ignore them for now.

To run this project, open a terminal and run  
docker run -p 4443:4443 --rm -e OPENVIDU_SECRET=MY_SECRET openvidu/openvidu-server-kms:2.18.0

Then, run  
npm start  
inside openvidu-react-hello-world folder.

// Issues
1) When two users are connected to the same session, if one leaves by closing the tab,
the other user sees a frozen screen that goes away after some seconds. On the other
hand, if one leaves by clicking the "leave" button, the other user's screen gets
updated immediately.
-Seems to work fine now.

2) React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'leaveSession'.
-Solved by wrapping leaveSession function with useCallback hooks.
Is there a better solution?
